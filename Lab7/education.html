        <h2>Hainesport School</h2>
        <p>
          My favorite class was my eighth grade English class because the
          teacher really cared and she taught us a lot.
        </p>
        <aside>
          I have lots of memories from this school as this was the school I went
          to from 1st to 8th grade but I will always remember the fun I had with
          my friends who I am still friends with to this day.

        <h2>Rancocas Valley Regional High School</h2>
        <p>
          My favorite class was my engineering class because it was with the
          boys.
        </p>
        <aside>
          One of my favorite memories from high school is that I will always
          remember lunch out senior year with the boys.

        <h2>Stevens Institute of Technology</h2>
        <p>
          My favorite class at Stevens so far is CS146 because I learned a lot
          and I didn't fall asleep in there.
        </p>
        <aside>
          The best memories I have from Stevens so far are the times I've spent
          with my roommates in our apartment and running together.
