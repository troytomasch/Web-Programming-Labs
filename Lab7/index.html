      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        I am a junior at Stevens Institute of Technology and I am majoring in
        computer science. I run cross country and track for the school. I am 20
        years old and I am from a small town in South Jersey called Hainesport.

      <p>
        Last summer I worked at Lutron Electronics on their iOS app. I had a
        really great experience and I want to work in iOS again if I have the
        opportunity. Currently, I am looking for my next summer internship. I
        want to work at a company that is involved with running or fitness.
